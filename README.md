## Calorimeter properties

You are asked to instrument an electromagnetic calorimeter 12 m downstream of an interaction point at the LHC in the pseudo-rapidity range of 2.5 to 3. A colleague simulated the processes  
**B⁺ → π⁰π⁺** and **D⁰ → K⁺K⁻π⁻π⁺π⁰**, with **π⁰ → γγ** for you and gave you access to csv files containing 4-vectors of the photons (**⃗p, E in GeV**). Assume that all photons originate from (0,0,0):

**a)** Which is the maximum (quadratic) cell size, such that in at least 68.3% of the cases, the photons from the π⁰ decay end up in separate cells? Check both processes and make histograms for the opening angle between photons and their distance on the calorimeter surface.

**b)** What is the mass resolution of the π⁰ peaks given the reconstructed results of a) and an ECAL resolution of σ_E/E = 4.2%/√E[GeV].  
Hint: in order to emulate the reconstruction step, apply a Gaussian smearing to the simulated energy of an accepted candidate. Prepare a histogram that shows the π⁰ mass peak.

**c)** Comment on the results. Do you think it would be possible to build both calorimeters? Think about, and name at least 4 typical constraints, and technical challenges that you would face when trying to build the calorimeter. Remember to cite your sources.
